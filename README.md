# LIBRARY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM
The project titled Library Management System is an application developed to monitor and control the activities performed in a library such as: updating the books available in the library which includes adding new editions of the books and deleting the older ones, viewing and searching the book details, issuing the books and many more. Through the above proposed library management system it is possible to overcome the problems faced by the existing manual library management system. Managing a library manually can be a tedious task. There are higher probabilities of data loss in the case of manual library management system and performing all the tasks in a library without software involves a lot of manual labor. Therefore to make the process of managing a library easier and effective the above proposed library management system can be adapted.
